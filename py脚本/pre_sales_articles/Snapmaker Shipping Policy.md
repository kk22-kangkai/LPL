## **Shipping Warehouse**

Our production warehouse is located in Shenzhen, China, with regional shipping warehouses in the United States, Canada, Germany, Australia, and the United Kingdom.

If you're located in one of these regions, your order will typically be shipped from the nearest local warehouse. However, if the local warehouse is out of stock, your package will be shipped from our warehouse in China.

For orders placed from regions outside the ones listed above, shipping will be fulfilled directly from our Chinese warehouse.

## **Delivery Time**

Orders will be processed and shipped within 1-3 business days from the purchase date (excluding pre-order items). Standard shipping usually takes 3-7 business days. For shipping times specific to machines and modules, please refer to: [When can I expect my order to be shipped? ](https://support.snapmaker.com/hc/en-us/articles/28585558421399-When-can-I-expect-my-order-to-be-shipped)

_Note: Delivery Time = Processing Time + Shipping Time_
