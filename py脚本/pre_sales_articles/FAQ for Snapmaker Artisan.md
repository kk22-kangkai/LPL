#### **51. Maintenance Notes**

To ensure the machine's continued performance and longevity, we've provided some essential [maintenance guidelines](https://wiki.snapmaker.com/en/snapmaker_artisan/maintenance) on our Wiki website. From cleaning to firmware updates, our guide covers everything you need to keep your machine running smoothly:

![Maintenance.png](https://support.snapmaker.com/hc/article_attachments/25466680469399)

  * After finishing the 3D printing job, please remember to [clean the filament residues that are stuck on the nozzle surface](https://wiki.snapmaker.com/en/snapmaker_artisan/maintenance/clean_the_nozzle). Otherwise, they may cause nozzle jams or leave dark marks on your next print.

  * If you are using the 20W/40W Laser Module, you need to frequently [clean the heat dissipation fan](https://wiki.snapmaker.com/en/general/maintenance/clean_heat_dissipation_fan_of_20w_&_40w_laser_module) since the excessive dust accumulated on it may affect its heat dissipation performance.




![Maintance 1.png](https://support.snapmaker.com/hc/article_attachments/25466695075223)

  * After a period of laser machining, tar may accumulate on the steel strip of the linear module. In such a case, you need to [clean the steel strip](https://wiki.snapmaker.com/en/general/maintenance/clean_steel_strip).
