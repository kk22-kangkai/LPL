ARTISAN/RAY ROTARY MODULE (WITH 1.5M EXTENSION CORD): This option includes both the Rotary Module and a 1.5m Extension Cord. To use the Rotary Module on Snapmaker Artisan or Ray, the Extension Cord is required. For installation guidance, please refer to: [Installation Guide](https://wiki.snapmaker.com/en/snapmaker_artisan/manual#quick-start-3).

A250/A250T/A350/A350T ROTARY MODULE BUNDLE: This bundle includes the Rotary Module and an Emergency Stop Button. If you are using the Rotary Module with Snapmaker 2.0 (A250/A250T/A350/A350T), you do not need to purchase the Extension Cord separately.
