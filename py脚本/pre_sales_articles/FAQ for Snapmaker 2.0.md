**1\. What are the differences between the A series, AT series, and F series?**

The A series, AT series, and F series are collectively referred to as Snapmaker 2.0.

**The A series** is a 3-in-1 printer with a 3D printing module, a 1.6W laser module, and a 50W CNC module, available in three models: A150, A250, and A350, differentiated by their working areas.

**The AT series** upgrades the A series with enhanced 3D printing, linear, and power modules for quieter operation, featuring two models: A250T and A350T.

**The F series,** based on the AT series, includes only a 3D printing module and excludes the 1.6W Laser Module and 50W CNC Module. It has two models, F250 and F350, that can be upgraded to a 3-in-1 printer with additional laser and CNC modules.

#### **2\. Does the A/AT/F Model support a Heated Bed temperature higher than 80℃?**

In theory, the Heated Bed of the A/AT/F Model can be heated up to 80℃–100℃ at the expense of time. Generally, the Heated Bed takes about 20 to 30 minutes to reach such a temperature.

#### 

#### **3\. Can Snapmaker 2.0 engrave or cut metal?**

Neither the 1.6W Laser Module nor the CNC Module of the Snapmaker 2.0 can engrave or cut metal. However, the 10W, 20W, and 40W Laser Modules are capable of engraving metals. Click [here ](https://shop.snapmaker.com/pages/laser-modules-comparison)to compare the different Laser Modules. 

#### 

**4\. What is the layer thickness of the Snapmaker 2.0?**

Snapmaker can print layers as thin as 50 microns and up to 300 microns (lower number means better resolution).

#### **5\. As an EU user, can I buy the A250T/A350T without the Enclosure?**
